- Enables you to rapildy build a large pool of quiz questions. Each worksheet is a different quiz.
- Export to CANVAS by pressing CTRL+E (Export). The macro checks your input for errors, then exports a QTI-format ZIP file (QTI version 1.2 for Classic Quizzes). [Here are instruction on how to import the QTI-format ZIP-file into CANVAS](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-import-quizzes-from-QTI-packages/ta-p/1046). It gets imported as an unpublished Classic Quiz. After importing the quiz, you have to set up the following details in CANVAS: 
- Supports quiz groups. Each group can cover specific learning goals. You can therefore build randomized quizzes with large pool of questions in each group. This ensures that each repetition of the quiz covers all learning goals, even though it is randomized.
- You can use **HTML-formatting**, **equations**, and **images** in the question text (column **C**) and feedback text (column **D**). Question types *multiple_choice_question* and *multiple_answers_question* can also have HTML, equations and images  in answers (Columns **E** and **F**):
  - HTML formatting examples: &lt;b&gt;**bold**&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;*italics*&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;u&gt;<ins>underline</ins>&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;<sub>subscript</sub>&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;<sup>supscript</sup>&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;a href="*URL*"&gt;*link*&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;new line, etc.
  - Equations are in LaTeX syntax, i.e. **/(y=x^2/)** for inline equations, or **/\[y=x^2/]** to display the equation centre-aligned on its own line.
  - Images are in Markdown syntax, i.e.  **\!\[*descrption*](*filepath*)** if you know the file path of the image on your PC, or **\!\[*description*]** if you want to browse to locate the image file on your PC when you export the quiz. All www image formats are supported. Images are shown centre-aligned, and at 100% size.
- You can exploit **automated quiz generation** in two alternative ways:
  - You can edit a quiz manually in the spreadsheet, using copy-paste to generate large pools of questions, and optionally exploit Excel features such as cell formulae and referencing, e.g. =RND(), and paramtric text, e.g. ="What is " & ROW() & "Ã—10 ?"
  - ...or you can write VBA code to automatically generate randomized quiz questions! See subroutine '**UserGenerate()**' as an example, which generates 100 questions. You can edit the VBA source code to suit your needs.
- An advantage of quizXL over editing a quiz in CANVAS is that you can have more complex equations ([all Excel worksheet functions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-functions-by-category-5f91f4e9-7b42-46d2-9bd1-63f26a86c0eb)) in question type Formula Question '**calculated_question**'. CANVAS has a limited set of [helper functions](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Resource-Documents/Canvas-Formula-Quiz-Question-Helper-Functions/ta-p/387062).
