# quizXL
quizXL is a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel application that can generate and export Classic Quizzes (QTI version 1.2 format ZIP-file), and both learning outcomes (.CSV), to the CANVAS LMS digital learning platform

**Features**
- Full support for all 9 question types in CANVAS Classic Quizzes.
- Enables you to rapildy build a large pool of quiz questions. Each worksheet is a different quiz. Export to CANVAS by pressing CTRL+E (Export). The macro checks your input for errors, then exports a QTI-format ZIP file (QTI version 1.2 for Classic Quizzes).
- Supports quiz groups. Each group can cover specific learning goals. You can therefore build randomized quizzes with large pool of questions in each group. This ensures that each repetition of the quiz covers all learning goals, even though it is randomized.
- Supports LaTeX maths equations, both in the question text and feedback when the question is answered wrongly
- Supports HTML elements, both in question text and feedback. You can therefore format fonts, e.g. <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <u>underline</u>, <br> line breaks, <a href..>links</a>, etc.
- Supports inclusion of bitmap images (all file formats that web browsers support, e.g. jpg, png) in the question. The image is shown centre-aligned below the question text.
